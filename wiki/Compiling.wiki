= How to compile and flash the code =


How to compile and flash arduino code is documented many times on the web.

A good entry point is here: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/Cfg_Update_Firmware

But don't use their hex file of course, but compile the right one for minRXOSD.

And use the 'OSD Config Tool' from the code section trunk/Tools, it's the same as of my other project minOPOSD.

Before you compile the minRXOSD hex file you can change the layout for your needs by editing the following defines in OSD_Panels.ino:

#define PAN_WARN_X

#define PAN_WARN_Y

#define PAN_CHAN_STAT_X_OLDER	

#define PAN_CHAN_STAT_Y_OLDER	

#define PAN_CHAN_STAT_X_FROM_V25

#define PAN_CHAN_STAT_Y_FROM_V25

#define PAN_RX_STAT_X_FROM_V25

#define PAN_RX_STAT_Y_FROM_V25
